          1. Hearing Aid and Hearing Test: The Hearing Aid feature has received
          FDA authorization. The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are
          supported on AirPods Pro 2 with the latest firmware paired with a
          compatible iPhone or iPad with iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 and later and are
          intended for people 18 years old or older. The Hearing Aid feature is
          also supported on a compatible Mac with macOS Sequoia and later. It is
          intended for people with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss.
        </p>

          Hearing Protection: The Hearing Protection feature works with AirPods
          Pro 2 with the latest firmware when paired with a compatible iPhone,
          iPad, or Mac with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, or macOS Sequoia and later.
          Feature is only available in the U.S. and Canada. See
          support.apple.com/120850 for total attenuation and more information.
          The Hearing Protection feature is not suitable for protection against

          2. Trade‑in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
          configuration of your eligible trade‑in device. Not all devices are
          eligible for credit. You must be at least the age of majority to be
          eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade‑in
          value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added

          qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate was
          made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device
          purchase. In‑store trade‑in requires presentation of a valid photo ID
          (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be
          available in all stores, and may vary between in‑store and online
          trade‑in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its
          trade‑in partners reserve the right to refuse, cancel, or limit
          quantity of any trade‑in transaction for any reason. More details are
          available from Apple’s trade-in partner for trade‑in and recycling of
          eligible devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.
